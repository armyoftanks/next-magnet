# next-frontend

Copy the next-magnet folder to your local environment

To get the app running locally without creating a new app, you'll typically need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you've pulled the app's files. Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the required packages.

2. **Start the Development Server**: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server to run the app locally. Use the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the development server, and you should see output indicating that the app is running on a specific port (usually `http://localhost:3000` by default).

3. **Access the App**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated in the terminal output). You should see your Next.js app running locally.
